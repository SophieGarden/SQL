6.
Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept = dept.id
GROUP BY dept.name

Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.


SELECT name, CASE WHEN dept = 1 OR dept = 2 THEN 'Sci' WHEN dept = 3 THEN 'Art' ELSE 'None' END
