3.
Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.


SELECT id, name
FROM stops JOIN route ON stops.id = route.stop
WHERE route.num = '4' AND route.company = 'LRT'
;

Routes and stops
4.
The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.


SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
Having COUNT(*) = 2
Submit SQLRestore default
Correct answer
company	num	COUNT(*)
LRT	4	2
LRT	45	2
5.
Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.


SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 AND b.stop = 149
Submit SQLRestore default
Correct answer
company	num	stop	stop
LRT	4	53	149
LRT	45	53	149
6.
The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'


SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name = 'London Road'

Submit SQLRestore default
Correct answer
company	num	name	name
LRT	4	Craiglockhart	London Road
LRT	45	Craiglockhart	London Road

WHERE a.stop = 115 AND b.stop = 137

Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.


SELECT stopb.name, b.company, b.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.num = b.num AND a.company = b.company)
           JOIN stops stopa ON a.stop = stopa.id

Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Sighthill.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

Hint
Self-join twice to find buses that visit Craiglockhart and Sighthill, then join those on matching stops.

SELECT DISTINCT start.num, start.company, name, end.num, end.company
FROM (SELECT a.num, a.company, b.stop as transfer1
             FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.num = b.num AND a.company = b.company)
             WHERE a.stop = (SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart')
             ) start
             JOIN
             (SELECT c.num, c.company, c.stop as transfer2
             FROM route c JOIN route d ON (c.num = d.num AND c.company = d.company)
             WHERE d.stop = (SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name = 'Sighthill')
             ) end
             ON start.transfer1 = end.transfer2
